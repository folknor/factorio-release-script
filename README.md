Lua script for producing releases of github-hosted Factorio mods.

This actually depends on my fork of ok.sh for a single fix at https://github.com/folknor/ok.sh until merged into mainline.

Requires https://github.com/zserge/luash and https://github.com/whiteinge/ok.sh.
Please remember to set up ok.sh properly.
Also requires https://stedolan.github.io/jq/
